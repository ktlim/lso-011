\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
This document outlines possible data
releases derived in conjunction with the LSST  operations plan.
All data release are seen as operations or pre operations activities - the MREFC project, including commissioning did not foresee serving data to the the community.
During the commissioning and operations  the plan will have to
be adjusted according to the success of the data reductions (quality of the data
products), resources available for preparing and supporting a release, and the need for incremental
releases (i.e. will a new intermediate release be a significant improvement on the previous
release).

The capability level of an Data Access Centre will also have to be considered - the final platform is well understood \citeds{LDM-554}
but at what point specific features may become available is discussed here also.

This document does not present a release schedule, instead we present a
release scenario which may or may not play out depending on the many unknowns and caveats
on the various data releases and available resources.

Unless the data access policy changes data releases in this document concerning delivering data to LSST Data Rights holders (US, Chilean, and named international contributors).
