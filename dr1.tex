\section{First Data Release } \label{sect:dr1}

DR1 is to be a release of the first six months data to occur one year after the start of operations.

This Release would include some of the products from section 4 of \DPDD including:

\begin{itemize}
\item  Raw images
\item  Processed images and coadds
\item  Catalogs including

\begin{itemize}

For the first release we may not produce catalogs in crowded fields.
